# GuessTheWord

Simple wordle game made in js, if you connect the js file with some kind of list with 5 letter words, then its fully automated.
How it works? 
js file makes grid where you can write any word, then if you press enter it will pass the player input to function wchich checks the input, if any letter of user input
is on the same place as set word then it colors the square green, the game checks if input is 5 letters, and its letting player know by alert if the word is too short.
If player guesses the right word then aler pops up with 'you won' text otherwise it says 'you lost' and refreshes the page to make all tiles blank.
